    "description": "This is a sublibrary of the one designed for Proliferation Screen, restricted to hit gRNAs (in distal DHSs, showing an effect on cell proliferation) in ~3,200 DHSs. Cells were transfected at a high MOI, with a median of 7 gRNAs per cell. The readout is single-cell RNA-seq, and includes data for both gRNAs protospacers and mRNA transcripts.",
