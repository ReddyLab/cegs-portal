            <h3>What is the CCGR Data Portal?</h3>

            <p>
                The Duke Center for Combinatorial Gene Regulation (CCGR) aims to make combinatorial studies of
                regulatory elements and noncoding variants routine. To that end, a major focus of the CCGR is
                developing resources and technologies for combinatorial manipulation of the human genome.
                In support of that mission, the CCGR data portalâ€“ serves as a central hub where results from
                functional characterization studies from the CCGR, ENCODE, IGVF, and other projects can be
                collectively explored and analyzed.

            <h3>What can I do with the Portal?</h3>

            <p>
                The CCGR Portal has many ways to explore the data. Users can:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>See what has been tested within a genomic region</li>
                <li>Check in on their gene of intrest to see if anyone else has found associated regulatory elements</li>
                <li>Get an overview of one or more experiment's coverage</li>
                <li>Download selected data for further offline analysis</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
