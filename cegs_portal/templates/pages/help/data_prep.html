    <h2>Experiment Data Format</h2>
    <p>
        Experiment data is the data we need from the experiment that isn't specific to an analysis. This includes
        the locations of tested elements and associated elements, if applicable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The experiment data file is a tab-separated list of values. We often call it "tested_elements.tsv", but the name
        can be anything as long as it's also in the <a href="/help/metadata/" class="link">metadata file</a>.
        The columns are as follows:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>chrom</dt>
        <dd>Tested element chromosome</dd>

        <dt>start</dt>
        <dd>Tested element start location (0-indexed)</dd>

        <dt>end</dt>
        <dd>Tested element end location (0-indexed)</dd>

        <dt>strand</dt>
        <dd>Tested element strand</dd>

        <dt>bounds</dt>
        <dd>Tested element bounds. This is a string like <code>[]</code> (closed), <code>[)</code>  (half-open), or <code>()</code> (open)</dd>

        <dt>parent_chrom</dt>
        <dd>The chromosome of an associated element that is the "parent" of the tested element</dd>

        <dt>parent_start</dt>
        <dd>Parent element start location (0-indexed)</dd>

        <dt>parent_end</dt>
        <dd>Parent element end location (0-indexed)</dd>

        <dt>parent_strand</dt>
        <dd>Parent element strand</dd>

        <dt>parent_bounds</dt>
        <dd>
            Tested element bounds. This is a string like <code>[]</code> (closed),
            <code>[)</code>  (half-open), or <code>()</code> (open)
        </dd>

        <dt>facets</dt>
        <dd>
            Facets are used for categorization and filtering when searching. In the file these
            are key-value pairs in the form of <code>key=value</code> with a <code>;</code>
            separating pairs. With the <code>key</code> being the name of a facet and the
            <code>value</code> being a specific kind of <code>key</code>. For example, the
            facet might be "Assays" and the facet value might be "Flow-FISH CRISPR Screen"
            <a href="/search/facets/" class="link">This is the current list</a> of facets. If you want
            a new facet or to add a new facet value to an existing facet please
            <a href="mailto:ccgr_portal_admin@duke.edu?subject=Requesting%20New%20Facet" class="link">let us know!</a>
        </dd>

        <dt>misc</dt>
        <dd>
            This is any miscellaneous data you'd like included with each item. It should be
            in the same format as the facets. It won't be used for searching, it'll just exist
            in the database.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        If there are any columns that you don't need just leave them blank, don't remove them completely
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis Data Format</h2>
    <p>
        Analysis data is the data we need that is specific to a particular analysis. This includes the locations of tested elements,
        the effect sizes, and p values.
    </p>
    <p>
        The analysis data file is a tab-separated list of values. We often call it "observations.tsv", but the name can be anything as
        long as it's also in the <a href="/help/metadata/" class="link">metadata file</a>. The columns are as follows:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>chrom</th><th>start</th><th>end</th><th>strand</th><th>bounds</th><th>gene_name</th><th>gene_ensembl_id</th><th>raw_p_val</th><th>adj_p_val</th><th>effect_size</th><th>facets</th></tr>
    </table>
