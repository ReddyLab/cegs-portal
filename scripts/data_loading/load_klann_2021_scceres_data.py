# The following lines should work as expected when using postgres. See
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/querysets/#bulk-create
#
#     If the modelâ€™s primary key is an AutoField, the primary key attribute can
#     only be retrieved on certain databases (currently PostgreSQL and MariaDB 10.5+).
#     On other databases, it will not be set.
#
# So the objects won't need to be saved one-at-a-time like they are, which is slow.
#
# In postgres the objects automatically get their id's when bulk_created but
# objects that reference the bulk_created objects (i.e., with foreign keys) don't
# get their foreign keys updated. The for loops do that necessary updating.
